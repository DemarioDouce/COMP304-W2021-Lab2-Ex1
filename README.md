LeaseOrRentHome Inc. helps its clients to find the best option for a home. 
Your team is assigned to develop an Android application based on the following specifications:

* The main screen will display the company logo and a button “Enter”.
* The second screen allows the potential customer to choose the home types:
  * apartment
  * detached home
  * semi-detached home
  * condominium
  * townhouse

Use an options Menu control to implement the selection of home types. Display a user-friendly screen 
with available homes whenever the user selects a home type from the menu. 
For example, if the user selects the apartment home type, the next screen will display the available apartments (address, rent price, and image). 

Use check boxes to select the apartments that you want to visit (virtually or physically).

The user may use the menu control to choose another home type, and so on.


* The check-out screen displays the selected homes and corresponding addresses, and prices. Use a radio group for listing selected homes. The user can now choose the home (assuming the user has visited all selected homes).

* The next screen prompts the user with a payment option (cash, credit card, debit card). Use a group of radio buttons to select the payment method.

* The last screen asks the user to enter credit/debit card information if the user chooses either of these payment methods. Use EditText controls and other GUI elements to allow the user to enter customer’ information: full name, credit/debit card number. The rest of the fields will be different for each student. For example, you may create fields for favourite sport, favourite team, favourite food, etc. Create 2-3 fields named as mentioned above. Provide validation for these entries using the proper attributes/methods/constructor for each GUI control.

* Use Application preferences for storing user selections as the user navigates through the various screens of the application.

Use TextView objects to display information as needed. Use styles and themes to create a nice look and feel of your app. Use drawable objects to display the logo for the company, home types, homes, etc.
